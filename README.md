# javascriptVisualizationChallenge

## Notes
Code drew heavily from StackOverflow, GeeksforGeeks, and the D3 & Plotly documention

## Purpose
This code is meant to use Javascript and Plotly to display a given dataset, and give it interactivity by being able to select from a range of data.
In this case, the code creates a dropdown menu to select samples and creates a bubble chart and a bar chart to display the bacteria cultures found in subject's belly buttons. 

## Operation
This code is posted on Github pages, thus the page can be visited from a web browser. If the user desires, the entire repository can be downloaded. Using a text editor and a live server, the user can
"Go Live" to interact with the webpage as well.

Once you have reached the homepage of the website, the dropdown menu can be clicked and sample ids can be selected, which will in turn change the bar chart and bubble charts
